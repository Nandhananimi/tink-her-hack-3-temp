### Project Description
 "Nirbhaya" project addresses the growing safety concerns for women and children by leveraging technology to provide a reliable, real-time safety solution.
This project not only aims to solve a pressing issue but also aligns with our values of technological innovation and social responsibility.
The aim of the project "Nirbhaya" is to design and develop a prototype safety device integrated with advanced technologies to ensure the protection and security of women and children in distress situations.
This prototype focuses on demonstrating the feasibility and functionality of an affordable and portable safety device that can later be scaled into a market-ready solution to address the growing need for women and child safety.



### The Problem statement
Women, especially those who live alone, work late hours, or have medical conditions, face risks such as accidental falls, physical harassment, or other emergencies. Current safety solutions often rely on manual activation, which may not always be feasible during critical situations.Personal safety for Women, workplace safety, Child safety, Safety for hikers and solo travelers.

### The Solution
By this system we can Empower Safety,Enable Freedom - A Gaurdian of Hope and Security for Women & Children.This system enhances personal safety, reduces response time during emergencies, and promotes a sense of security for vulnerable populations in various scenarios. Its cost-effective and user-friendly design makes it a practical solution for¬†widespread¬†use.

Workflow Summary
1. Initialization:
The Arduino Nano initializes all components (MPU-6050, GPS, GSM, etc.) during startup.
2. Monitoring:
Continuously monitors the MPU-6050 for fall detection and the push button for manual SOS activation.
3. Action on Emergency:
Fall Detected/Manual Button Press:
Fetches location data from the GPS module.
Sends an alert SMS with the location using the GSM module.
Activates the buzzer to attract nearby attention.
4. Standby Mode:
Returns to monitoring after sending the alert, waiting for further input¬†or¬†events.


For Hardware:

# Schematic & Circuit
![Circuit]![ckt dia](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f28fec1e-2bc9-465c-979b-9020bca51503)

 1. Central Controller - Arduino Nano
 The Arduino Nano acts as the brain of the system, coordinating all components.It reads inputs from sensors and buttons, processes data, and controls output actions like sending alerts and activating the buzzer.
2. Inputs
Push Button:Used for manual SOS activation.
When pressed, it triggers the Arduino to send an alert SMS with GPS location to the predefined contacts.
MPU-6050:
A 6-axis motion-tracking sensor that includes an accelerometer and gyroscope.
Detects falls or abnormal movements by analyzing acceleration and orientation data.
Communicates with the Arduino via I2C protocol.
3. Outputs
Buzzer:
Provides an audible alarm to attract attention in case of an emergency.
Activated when the Arduino detects a fall or when the SOS button is pressed.
4. Communication Modules
SIM800L (GSM Module):
Responsible for sending SMS alerts to emergency contacts.
Controlled by the Arduino using AT commands through serial communication.
Neo-6M (GPS Module):
Provides real-time location coordinates (latitude and longitude).
The Arduino uses this data to include the user's location in the SMS alert.

1. The system uses the GPS module to obtain location data.
2. The accelerometer detects falls or impacts and sends an interrupt signal to the microcontroller.
3. When a fall is detected or the push button is pressed, the microcontroller sends an SOS message with the location data to the emergency contact number via the GSM module.
4. The buzzer alerts the user in case of an emergency.
